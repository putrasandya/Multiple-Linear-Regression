# Multiple-Linear-Regression
Electrical Energy Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression
The dataset contains 47840 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), 
when the power plant was set to work with full load.

Objective is: To predict the net hourly electrical energy output (PE) using Multiple Linear Regression
Result from the model :
1. The model's average prediction error is 4.24 units.
2. The average deviation of predictions from actual values is around 5.32 units.
3. A score of 0.89 means that 89% of the variance in the data is explained by the model.
